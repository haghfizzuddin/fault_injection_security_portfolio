# Fault Injection Security Research Portfolio

A collection of fault injection concepts, simulations, and demonstrations developed to explore hardware security evaluation techniques.

## Overview

This repository documents my self-directed study into fault injection attacks and countermeasures, building upon my electronics engineering background and security research experience. While I'm new to formal fault injection evaluation, these projects demonstrate my understanding of core concepts and readiness to learn advanced techniques.

## Motivation

Having worked with SCADA/ICS systems and critical infrastructure, I've witnessed firsthand how hardware faults can compromise entire systems. This portfolio bridges my hardware engineering foundation with security evaluation methodologies.

## Repository Structure

**1. Fundamentals**
- Fault Injection Theory - Overview of FI attack principles
- Attack Taxonomy - Voltage, Clock, EM, and Laser techniques
- Real-World Impact - Why FI evaluation matters

**2. Simulations - Learning**
- PIN Bypass Simulator - Demonstrates timing attacks on authentication
- Glitch Parameter Sweep - Explores glitch width vs success rate
- AES Fault Attack - Differential Fault Analysis simulation

**3. Hardware Concepts - Learning**
- Arduino Glitch Controller - Conceptual voltage glitcher
- Python Automation - Test scripting for iterative attacks
- Setup Documentation - Understanding evaluation lab requirements

**4. Analysis & Reporting**
- Sample Evaluation Report - Mock security evaluation
- Statistical Analysis - Success rate analysis methods
- Countermeasure Assessment - Evaluating protection mechanisms

## Technologies Used

Languages: Python, C/Arduino, JavaScript
Analysis: NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter
Concepts: Power analysis, Timing attacks, Differential Fault Analysis
Background: SCADA/ICS, Embedded Systems, Critical Infrastructure

## Learning Path

In Progress: ChipWhisperer tutorials (theory sections), "The Hardware Hacker's Handbook" (Chapters 1-3),

In Progress: Advanced glitching techniques, EM fault injection theory, ISO/IEC 17825 standard review

Planned: Practical experience with ChipWhisperer-Lite, Formal evaluation methodology training, Advanced countermeasure analysis

## Key Insights

Through this self-study, I've learned that successful fault injection requires systematic methodology (not random attempts, but structured parameter exploration), pattern recognition (identifying vulnerable code patterns and timing windows), statistical rigor (distinguishing true vulnerabilities from noise), and clear reporting (translating technical findings for diverse stakeholders).


## Next Steps

While these simulations provide theoretical understanding, I'm eager to work with real fault injection equipment, learn from experienced evaluators, contribute to advancing FI evaluation methodologies, and apply these techniques to secure real-world products.

This portfolio demonstrates foundational knowledge in fault injection concepts. I'm actively seeking opportunities to formalize this knowledge through hands-on evaluation experience and professional training.
